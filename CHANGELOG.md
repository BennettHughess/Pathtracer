Version 0.6.0

Changes:

- Added a Python class, `pathtracer.py`, which can now create scripted videos using the main executable.
    - The script can also be executed with `python pathtracer.py` to create an example video (which can be easily edited).
- A `requirements.txt` file was also created for easy creation of a .venv if needed.
- Updated README.md
