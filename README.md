# Raytracer

This project is a raytracer, which will eventually be retooled and repackaged into a general relativistic raytracer - ideally, one which can generate images of a Schwarzschild black hole.

Current files:

- `main.cpp`
    - Compile and run this to execute the main code.
- `vec3.h`
    - This file contains the `Vec3` class, which describes three-dimensional vectors.
- `color.h`
    - This file contains the requisite code to write a pixel to an ouput stream.
