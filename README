# Raytracer

This project is a raytracer, which will eventually be retooled and repackaged into a general relativistic raytracer - ideally, one which can generate images of a Schwarzschild black hole.

Current files:

- `main.cpp`
    - Compile and run this to execute the main code.
- `vec3.h` and `vec3.cpp`
    - This file contains the `Vec3` class, which describes three-dimensional vectors.
- `pathtracer.h` and `pathtracer.cpp`
    - This file contains the `Path` class, which allows for pathtracing.
- `debug.cpp`
    - This file is used in place of `main.cpp`, and is used exclusively for debugging
