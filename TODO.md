# TO DO

- Restructure the Background and Camera classes to take input from the Scenario class and make it easier to develop code new code for different scenarios/metrics.
- Add "planet orbiting black hole" scenario
- Add better error handling and add a defined list of errors
- Optimize existing codebase
    - What if I passed everything as a float on the GPU side of things?
    - Better warp allocation on the GPU side? Profile the code.
