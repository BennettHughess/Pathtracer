# TO DO

## Near-term goals
- Make a python wrapper for the codebase to script everything
    - This could be used to make videos

## Longer term goals
- Add better error handling and add a defined list of errors
- Optimize existing codebase
    - What if I passed everything as a float on the GPU side of things?
    - Better warp allocation on the GPU side? Profile the code.
- Restructure the Background and Camera classes to take input from the Scenario class and make it easier to develop code new code for different scenarios/metrics.
