# TO DO

- Optimize existing codebase
- Run the code on the GPU
- Make the codebase play nicer with different metrics
    - Let each metric have their own collision conditions
    - Let each metric have their own `get_image_coords` function (this is necessary because you may need to convert from arbitrary coordinates to spherical coordinates)
